# TF-Object-Detection

**Firstly**, I have tried to implement Style Transfer, classify FashinMNIST using CNN and CIFAR10.

The results and detailed descriptions of implementation are presented in StyleTransfering notebook.

**Secondly**, I have tried to perfom object detection using YOLOv3 model.

And here is example photo, where immediately and false positives (lemon adopted for orange), and omissions (not seen Apple).

Also, here are examples of successful detection of heavily overlapped objects and an example of a poor response in ideal conditions.

Detailed description of implementation in the notebook ObjectDetection_YOLO3.
